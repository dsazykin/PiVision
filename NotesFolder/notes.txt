"""
Logging in would be only for the preset of mappings.
Controlling the computer is possible from all accounts.
Mappings would have a "default".
Once logged in, the user can use gestures to control the pc.
"""
Logging in:

- gestures for logging in.
    - "chained" gestures for password (access to the Pi functionality, not the pc)
    - max of 3 gestures per password (as of right now, might be more in the future)
    - the model should not recognize the gestures twice.
    - maybe a cooldown between recognition (3 secs?) 
    - feedback loop to acknowledge a gesture has been recognized / password is correct.

- Help menu for logging in (?)
    - what gestures can be recognized
    - password "rules"
